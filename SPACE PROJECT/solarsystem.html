        <h1 class="heading">Solar system</h1>
        <p class="text">
            The Solar System[d] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[11] It was formed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.

The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.

There is a strong consensus among astronomers[e] that the Solar System has at least nine dwarf planets: Ceres, Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust clouds. Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper belt (just outside Neptune's orbit).[f] Six planets, seven dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'.
			Mercury:
Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is a small, rocky world with a surface scarred by impact craters. It lacks a significant atmosphere, leaving its surface vulnerable to the Sun's intense radiation and extreme temperature variations. During its daytime, temperatures can soar to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius), while at night, they can plummet to around -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius). Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has patches of water ice in permanently shadowed craters near its poles, a mystery scientists are still unraveling.

Venus:
Venus, often called Earth's twin due to its similar size and composition, is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid that create a runaway greenhouse effect. This results in surface temperatures that exceed 860 degrees Fahrenheit (460 degrees Celsius), making it the hottest planet in our solar system. Despite its inhospitable surface, Venus showcases a range of geological features, including mountains, valleys, and vast volcanic plains. Its thick atmosphere prevents us from seeing its surface in visible light, but radar imaging has unveiled its geology in detail.

Earth:
Earth, our home planet, stands out as the only known celestial body to support life. With its diverse ecosystems, abundance of liquid water, and protective atmosphere, Earth fosters the conditions necessary for a variety of organisms to thrive. Its atmosphere primarily consists of nitrogen and oxygen, providing the essential components for life as we know it. Not only does Earth possess geological activity, such as plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, but it also showcases a rich tapestry of climates, landscapes, and environments, making it a unique gem in the cosmos.

Mars:
Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its rusty hue, has long captivated human imagination as a possible abode for life. Its surface features expansive deserts, towering volcanoes, deep valleys, and polar ice caps. Evidence suggests Mars once had liquid water flowing on its surface, hinting at a potentially habitable past. Current exploration efforts, including rovers and orbiters, continue to uncover the planet's mysteries, seeking clues to its geological history and the possibility of past or present life.

Jupiter:
Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, dominates with its immense size and colorful cloud bands. Composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, it hosts a dynamic atmosphere adorned with swirling storms and the iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth. Jupiter boasts an extensive system of moons, with the four largest — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — known as the Galilean moons, each showcasing unique characteristics and geological features.

Saturn:
Saturn, famous for its dazzling rings, is the second-largest planet in our solar system. These rings, made up of icy particles and debris, orbit Saturn in a spectacular display visible even from Earth. Beneath its rings lies a gas giant similar in composition to Jupiter, with hydrogen and helium dominating its atmosphere. Saturn also hosts a diverse array of moons, including Titan, notable for its thick atmosphere and similarities to early Earth, making it a target for future exploration.

Uranus:
Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, spins on its side, giving it a distinct axial tilt. This unique orientation results in extreme seasonal variations and a peculiar magnetic field. Composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, Uranus also contains methane, which gives it a bluish-green hue. Despite its distance from the Sun, Uranus exhibits a dynamic atmosphere with cloud bands and occasional storms. Its system of rings and diverse moons add to its enigmatic allure.

Neptune:
Neptune, the outermost gas giant in our solar system, boasts a dynamic atmosphere characterized by high-speed winds, large storms, and distinctive cloud patterns. Composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and methane, Neptune's deep blue coloration results from methane absorbing red light. It has a faint ring system and a collection of moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits in a retrograde direction and is geologically active, with cryovolcanism shaping its surface.</p>
