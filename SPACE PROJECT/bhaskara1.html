	<h1>Mission Overview:</h1>
    <font size="4"><p style="color: white;"><br>
Bhaskara-I and II were two satellites built by the Indian Space Research Organisation that formed India's first low-Earth orbit Earth observation satellite. They collected data oceanography and hydrology. Both satellites are named after ancient Indian mathematicians Bhāskara I and Bhāskara II.[2]<br><br>
Bhaskara-I, weighing 444 kg at launch, was launched on 7 June 1979 from Kapustin Yar aboard the Intercosmos launch vehicle. It was placed in an orbital Perigee and Apogee of 394 km and 399 km at an inclination of 50.7°.[3] The satellite consisted of-

Two television cameras operating in visible (600 nanometre) and near-infrared (800 nanometre) and collected data related to hydrology, forestry and geology.
Satellite microwave radiometer (SAMIR) operating at 19 and 22 GHz for study of ocean-state, water vapour, liquid water content in the atmosphere, etc.
An X-ray sky monitor operating in 2-10 keV energy range, to detect transient X-ray sources and monitor long term spectral and intensity changes in the X-ray sources.<br><br>
Bhaskara I, also known as Bhaskara Achārya or Bhaskaracharya, was a prominent Indian mathematician and astronomer who lived in the 12th century. His contributions to mathematics and astronomy were significant and have had a lasting impact on these fields.

Here's a detailed overview of Bhaskara I's life, works, and contributions:

Life and Background:
Bhaskara I was born in 1114 CE in Bijapur, Karnataka, India. He belonged to the mathematical tradition of the Bhaṭṭa school, which flourished during the medieval period in India. Little is known about his personal life, but his mathematical works have ensured his enduring legacy.

Mathematical Contributions:
Arithmetic:

Bhaskara I made significant contributions to arithmetic, particularly in the field of number theory. His works include solutions to indeterminate equations and methods for calculating square roots and cube roots.
Algebra:

He developed algebraic techniques for solving quadratic equations and studied properties of positive and negative numbers.
Geometry:

Bhaskara I contributed to geometric principles, including the study of shapes and their properties. His work encompassed areas like plane geometry, solid geometry, and geometric constructions.
Trigonometry:

He made advancements in trigonometry, including trigonometric identities and solutions to trigonometric equations. His trigonometric formulations laid the groundwork for later mathematicians' developments in this field.
Astronomy:

Bhaskara I was also an accomplished astronomer. He developed methods for calculating planetary positions and eclipses, and his astronomical observations helped refine existing models of the solar system.
Major Works:
Līlāvatī:

Bhaskara I's most famous work is "Līlāvatī," named after his daughter. It is a comprehensive treatise on arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. The book covers various mathematical concepts and provides practical solutions to mathematical problems.
Bījagaṇita:

Another important work by Bhaskara I is "Bījagaṇita," which focuses on algebra. It deals with equations, surds, and other algebraic topics.
Grahagaṇita:

"Grahagaṇita" is Bhaskara I's treatise on astronomy. It discusses planetary motion, eclipses, and other astronomical phenomena.
Legacy:
Bhaskara I's contributions laid the foundation for future developments in mathematics and astronomy in India. His works influenced subsequent mathematicians, both in India and abroad. The principles and methods he formulated continue to be studied and appreciated by mathematicians and historians of mathematics worldwide.

Bhaskara I's legacy also extends beyond mathematics. His emphasis on practical applications and problem-solving techniques exemplifies the rich tradition of Indian mathematics, which prioritized both theoretical rigor and real-world relevance.

<h1>Mission Overview:</h1>
    <font size="5"><p style="color: white;"><br> 

Bhaskara-I was ISRO's first experimental remote sensing satellite.
The satellite was named after Bhaskara-I, a renowned Indian mathematician from the 7th-century, known for his contributions to the decimal number system.
The primary mission of Bhaskara-I was to gather data for hydrology, oceanography, forestry and telemetry.
The satellite, weighing 442 kg at the time of launch, was launched using the Intercosmos launch vehicle, C-1 Intercosmos, from the Volgograd Launch Station in Russia.
The satellite was placed in an orbit with an inclination of 50.6°, an Apogee of 399 km, and a Perigee of 394 km.
It was equipped with two television cameras that operated in the visible and near infra-red spectrum.
Another important payload was the Satellite microwave radiometer (SAMIR) that functioned at 19 and 22 GHz and was used for studying water vapour, ocean-state, the liquid water content in the atmosphere and other parameters.
The onboard power of the satellite was 47 Watts and it had an orbit of 519 X 541 km.
The satellite was expected to function for one year, but its orbital life extended to about ten years. It re-entered in 1989.
Bhaskara-II, a second satellite of the same kind, was launched in November 1981.
Bhaskara-I transmitted extensive scientific data that was utilized for various studies, including oceanographic studies.
Aryabhatta, India’s first indigenously-built satellite, was launched on 19 th April 1975 by ISRO using a Soviet launch vehicle.
ISRO launched Chandrayaan-I, India’s first lunar mission, in 2008 and the Mars Orbiter Mission , India’s first mission to Mars, in 2014. ISRO has several more ambitious projects lined up for the future.
